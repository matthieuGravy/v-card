## Why create a v-card? 
I created a v-card as part of a responsive project. Here, I aimed to maintain the theme of the website and keep it minimalistic.
<br/>
<br/>
## Will the project evolve?
Certainly, I will be adding animations and improving responsiveness.
<br/>
<br/>
## What does this project contain? 
It's a virtual business card that redirects to social media and a website.
<br/>
<br/>
## How to install it? 
Navigate to the directory:
<code>cd v-card</code>

<br/>

Make sure you have Node.js version 18 LTS installed beforehand:
<code>npm i</code>
<br/>

And you can view the development version:
<code>npm run dev</code>
<br/>

Please note that the installation instructions assume Node.js version 18 LTS is already installed. If you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
